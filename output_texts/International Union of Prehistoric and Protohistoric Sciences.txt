The International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (Union internationale des sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques – UISPP) is a learned society, linked through the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences to UNESCO, and concerned with the study of prehistory and protohistory. In the words of its constitution:
The UISPP, as an international association of scholars, is founded on the principle of the universality of science. It firmly upholds academic freedom, recognizing that the study of humanity is relevant to all contemporary societies. In this spirit, the UISPP staunchly opposes any form of discrimination, whether based on race, creed, philosophical or ideological beliefs, ethnic or geographical background, nationality, gender, language, or any other criteria. Such discrimination, rooted in intolerance, inherently contradicts the scientific approach.
Furthermore, the UISPP rejects attempts to fictionally rewrite history or engage in negationism. As a non-governmental organization, it welcomes all bona fide scholars to participate in its scientific activities, regardless of their background or affiliations. This inclusive approach reflects the UISPP's commitment to fostering a diverse and open academic community dedicated to the advancement of knowledge about human prehistory and protohistory.[1]
The origins of the UISPP lie in an 1865 meeting of the Società italiana di scienze naturali (Italian Society of Natural Science) that led to the creation of the Congrès paléoethnologique international (CPI – International Palaeoethnological Congress). The first meeting of the CPI was held in Neuchâtel in 1866. The following year, in Paris, the name was changed to Congrès international d'anthropologie et d'archéologie préhistoriques (CIAAP – International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology).[2][3]
A permanent council of the CIAAP was founded in 1880, and regular congresses continued to be held until the outbreak of World War I disrupted the regular scholarly meetings, causing a hiatus in international academic collaboration and exchange. In the aftermath of the war, efforts to revive the tradition of regular congresses were spearheaded by the Institut international d'anthropologie (IIA – International Institute of Anthropology). However, this organization's structure and focus proved inadequate for the evolving needs of prehistoric and protohistoric research. The Institut's limited international perspective and the secondary role it assigned to the fields of prehistory and protohistory ultimately led to calls for the establishment of a more specialized body that would more closely continue the tradition of the CIAAP.[4] In response to these calls, the Congrès international des Sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques (CISPP – International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences) was formed in 1931, providing a dedicated platform for scholars active in prehistoric and protohistoric studies.[5] This new organization aimed to foster international collaboration and advance research in these specific fields, addressing the gaps left by its predecessor.[6] The creation of CISPP marked a significant step towards a more focused and globally-oriented approach to prehistoric and protohistoric sciences in the interwar period. Congresses were held in London in 1932 and in Oslo in 1936.[4]
However, the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II significantly impacted the activities of the CISPP, and the third congress originally planned for 1940 in Budapest had to be cancelled. No major congresses were held between 1936 and 1950, when a concerted effort by scholars from across Europe finally reestablished the tradition of regular international congresses for the prehistoric and protohistoric sciences, with the first post-war congress held in Zurich in 1950.[7] In 1955, the permanent council decided to affiliate the CISPP with a member organisation of UNESCO, the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences. This required a change of name, and in 1956 the CISPP became the Union internationale des sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques (UISPP – International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences). UISPP congresses subsequently emerged as a vital forum for scientific exchange, bridging the divide between scholars from both sides of the Iron Curtain, despite the tensions of the Cold War. This role as a conduit for east–west dialogue was made possible by adhering to the principle of intellectual neutrality, which explicitly does not regard participants as representatives of any state or government.[8] This approach proved key to fostering an environment of open academic discourse, transcending political boundaries and ideological differences. In 2019, UISPP joined the International Union of Academies (UAI – Union académique internationale).[4]
The structure of the UISPP has changed several times since its foundation, most recently in 2011, when the permanent council was abolished and individual and institutional memberships were introduced, making the organisation more democratic and transforming it into a fully representative body. Membership in the UISPP is open to all bona fide scholars. However, participation in its scientific commissions typically requires researchers to hold a PhD or be pursuing doctoral studies.[1]
The general assembly comprises all registered UISPP members and convenes during each world congress. It approves motions proposed by the executive eommittee and elects the president, general secretary, and treasurer. Additionally, the general assembly decides on the establishment and dissolution of scientific commissions and makes other significant decisions within the UISPP framework, following consultation with the executive committee.[1]
The executive committee comprises the members of the board (president, general secretary, treasurer, vice-president(s)) and the presidents of all UISPP scientific commissions. Working in tandem with the board, its role is to uphold the principles of the UISPP and to oversee the activities of scientific commissions and the broader organization. The executive committee also monitors preparations for the triennial world congress, intervening in its organization only when faced with unexpected events or significant delays in the program proposed by the national organizing committee.[1]
The primary objective of the UISPP's scientific commissions is to promote and coordinate international research in specific or specialized domains of prehistoric and protohistoric sciences between each world congress. The commissions are organized into six broader categories, although this list is not exhaustive.
The principal activities of a scientific commission are:
The frequency of UISPP congresses has evolved over time. Initially held every four years, they shifted to a five-year cycle in 1966 following UISPP's affiliation with CIPSH, aligning with UNESCO guidelines. Since 2011, world congresses have been organized triennially, aiming to alternate between Europe and other continents.
The XIth UISPP World Congress was originally to be held in Southampton in 1986. However, the decision of the British organising committee, led by Peter Ucko, to exclude South African and Namibian archaeologists for political reasons, despite the declared opposition of many of them to apartheid and despite that exclusion constituting a violation of UISPP statutes, led the UISPP to withdraw its endorsement of the congress and postpone the XIth World Congress until 1987. The British organising committee went ahead with the congress planned for Southampton under the new name of the World Archaeological Congress (WAC).[9][10] Whereas the majority of UISPP members rejected the split as a division of scholars and an opportunistic move, writing in 1987, Peter Ucko still described the UISPP as:
Despite these initial divides, since 2005 relations between UISPP and WAC have resumed. The UISPP remains focused on prehistoric and protohistoric research, while WAC evolved to focus primarily on politically committed approaches and advocacy. The two organisations therefore have different scopes.[12]
The XVIIIth World Congress of UISPP was held in Paris in June 2018. Its overarching theme was "Adaptation and sustainability of prehistoric and protohistoric societies confronted with climate change"1. This major congress formed part of the ongoing refoundation of Humanities led by the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences (which includes UISPP) and UNESCO. While all UISPP congresses have a general theme, they remain open to sessions on any other topic, which can be proposed during the general call for sessions.
The XIXth UISPP World Congress, originally planned for 2020 in Meknes, was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was ultimately held as a fully virtual event.[4]
UISPP has also adopted a new format alongside its triennial world congresses: continental congresses focusing on the prehistory and protohistory of specific regions. The first congress in this new format will be a multi-venue event in Java, Indonesia in 2025, with the main theme "Asian Prehistory Today: Bridging Science, Heritage and Development"
The UISPP awards several prizes to recognize excellence in archaeology and related sciences. These distinctions aim to acknowledge significant contributions to archaeological research in the fields of prehistory and protohistory, knowledge dissemination, and the promotion of prehistoric and protohistoric heritage. The awards are presented at each UISPP World Congress:
In addition to the publication of the proceedings from its congresses, UISPP since the 1950s has been overseeing the publication af a number of international monograph series aimed chiefly at the systematic publication of primary archaeological source material (Inventaria Archaeologica, Prähistorische Bronzefunde, Fiches typlogiques de l'industrie osseuse préhistorique) but also at specific themes of global interest (Human Societies facing Climate Change). Since 2018, UISPP has been publishing the peer-reviewed and open access Journal of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences / Revue de l'Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (short: UISPP Journal).[13]
