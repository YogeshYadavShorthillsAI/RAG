Gamble is currently part of the NERC-sponsored team that is looking to date key evolutionary events in Europe over the last 60,000 years by dating deposits of volcanic ash. The events that the team is seeking to date includes the arrival of modern humans, the Neanderthal extinction, and the post-Ice Age re-colonisation of northern Europe approximately 16,000 years ago by the direct ancestors of most modern Europeans.[5]
Gamble was a co-director on the British Academy Centenary project (2003-2010) Lucy to language: The archaeology of the social brain [5]
Gamble led a fieldwork programme in Greece, which recorded and published all the evidence from field surveys for Palaeolithic and Mesolithic settlement undertaken there in the last 50 years.[5] This led to the publication of The Prehistoric Stones of Greece which provided the first overview of all stone tools discovered in Greece. There is no comparable overview elsewhere in Europe.[1]
