Among human hunter-gatherer societies, males and females are responsible for the acquisition of different types of foods and shared them with each other for a mutual or familial benefit.[1] In some species, males and females eat slightly different foods, while in other species, males and females will routinely share food; but only in humans are these two attributes combined.[2]",

Language Acquisition: With a delayed PFC development, children might have more time to acquire Proto-Language Faculty (PFS), which is the faculty that allows humans to learn languages. This additional time could allow them to develop more complex language structures, including recursive elements, which are crucial for the development of modern human language. A phenomenon known as cryptophasia, or secret language, often occurs among young children living together, and it could have been more prevalent in communities with delayed PFC development.\n\n2.
