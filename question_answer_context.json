        "answer": "The early phase of archaeological research established that the Komani-Kruja settlements represented a local, non-Slavic population. This conclusion was drawn despite Yugoslav archaeology proposing a narrative that framed the population as Slavic, particularly in the region of western Macedonia. The archaeological evidence showed that these sites were not related to regions then inhabited by Slavs and no Slavic settlements had been founded in the 7th century, even in regions like Macedonia."
