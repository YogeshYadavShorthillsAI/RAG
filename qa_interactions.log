        "context": "Sexual division of labour (SDL) is the delegation of different tasks between the male and female members of a species. Among human hunter-gatherer societies, males and females are responsible for the acquisition of different types of foods and shared them with each other for a mutual or familial benefit.[1] In some species, males and females eat slightly different foods, while in other species, males and females will routinely share food; but only in humans are these two attributes combined.[2]",
        "generated_answer": "The Sexual Division of Labor (SDL) refers to the distribution of tasks, roles, and responsibilities between the sexes within a society or species. In the context of human hunter-gatherer societies, this often involves men primarily hunting large game, while women gather plants, nuts, fruits, and collect water. This division allows for a more efficient and effective use of resources, as each gender's tasks align with their physical strengths and limitations.\n\nCompared to other species, human SDL is unique in that it combines the sharing of food (as seen in many species) with a more distinct division of tasks.

Environmental Factors: Another explanation points to changes in the environment that made vocalization more advantageous.
